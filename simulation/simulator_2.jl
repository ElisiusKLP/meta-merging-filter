# Second Simulation Description

The second simulation extends the basic model by introducing **dynamic 
Gaussian boundaries** around the common source. This fluctuation affects 
only the **deviation from the common cause source** and **not the signal noise**. 
This dynamic is artificially introduced to control the induction of the 
ventriloquist effect in the participant. 

## Key Concept: Noise
- **Signal Noise**: Defines the reliability of each signal (auditory and visual), 
  representing the inherent uncertainty in the emitted signals.
- **Walk Noise**: Analogous to the noise in the underlying physical movement 
  of the source in space, this affects how the source position is updated.

## Key Differences:
- **Dynamic Boundary Growth**: The Gaussian boundary of the common source 
  varies according to predefined arrays of timesteps and standard deviations. 
  This fluctuation controls the deviation of the signals from the common 
  cause source and simulates the induction of the ventriloquist effect.
- **Effect on Independent Sources**: The independent sources are not directly 
  constrained by this boundary but continue to emit their signals with 
  standard signal and walk noise.
- **Shared Boundary**: Both auditory and visual signals emitted from the 
  common source are influenced by the same dynamic boundary, affecting their 
  deviation from the common source position.

## Simulation Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Similar to the basic simulation, but with a dynamic 
   Gaussian boundary starting from an initial standard deviation.
2. **Timestep Simulation**: 
   - The common source probability still determines whether signals 
     are from the common or independent sources.
   - The common source boundary changes dynamically over time, controlling 
     the deviation of auditory and visual signals from the common cause 
     source, while the inherent signal noise remains constant.
3. **Recording Data**: As in the basic simulation, but with the addition 
   of recording the current boundaryâ€™s standard deviation and its effect 
   on signal deviation from the common source.
4. **Output**: The output contains the time series of signal positions, 
   with the dynamic boundary reflecting the changing signal deviation.
